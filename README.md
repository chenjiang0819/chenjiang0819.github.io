###Introduction  
- The purpose of this project is to redesign the website of the Twangcentral.  
- Their old version of the website has zero responsive design. The webpage cannot even be wholly displayed on a smartphone screen. Thus, we need to design a mobile version of the website for them.  
- Furthermore, due to selling high priced products, we need to be very careful to avoid any suspect black patterns.
